# react-native-remote-push
Manager that allows you to:
 1. Request push notification permissions
 2. Get the device token back from the request
 3. Subscribe to remote push notifications

It's very basic code for now, but provides functionality above and beyond the PushNotificationIOS class that is provided as standard in react native.

... more to come!
